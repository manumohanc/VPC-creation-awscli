# VPC-creation-awscli
## Create entire VPC with help of AWSCLI
I was fairly adamant that I would never use a terminal or a Command prompt before I started learning Linux. I thought it was more difficult than working on a nice GUI and clicking a few buttons because it was visually unattractive and, more significantly, challenging. After using Linux for a few years, I was humbled into thinking that the terminal is the only easier and cleaner option. The keyboard had overtaken the mouse in strength. The keyboard had turned mightier than the mouse. The person I had become began to find the GUI of AWS Infrastructure Management challenging. At some point, I discovered the AWS CLI tools and began investigating different ways to control the AWS infrastructure without ever leaving my terminal. Here is what i learned.
